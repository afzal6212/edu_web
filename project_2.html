      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[3][4][5] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[6] But they often include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[6][3][7] However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[8][9][4] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. </p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's perspective. Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher, for example, in the form of transmitting knowledge and skills while doing so in a morally appropriate manner.[28][4][11] Student-centered definitions, on the other hand, outline education based on the student's experience in the learning process, for example, based on how education transforms and enriches their subsequent experience</p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal but on the informal level.[25][37][38] This usually means that there is no distinction between activities focused on education and other activities. Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of school and many or all adults may act as teachers. An important reason for moving to formal forms of education is due to the sheer quantity of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and well-trained teachers to be transmitted effectively.</p>
